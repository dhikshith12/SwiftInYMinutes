 Optionals are a swift language feature that either contains a value,

 Nil is roughly equivalent to `null` in other languages.

 If a type is not optional, it is guaranteed to have a value.
 
 Because Swift requires every property to have a type, even nil must be
 explicitly stored as an Optional value.
 
 Optional<T> is an enum, with the cases .none (nil) and .some(T) (the value)

// MARK: - Structures & classes

/*
 Structures and classes in Swift have many things in common. Both can:
 - Define properties to store values
 - Define methods to provide functionality
 - Define subscripts to provide access to their values using subscript syntax
 - Define initializers to set up their initial state
 - Be extended to expand their functionality beyond a default implementation
 - Conform to protocols to provide standard functionality of a certain kind

 Classes have additional capabilities that structures don't have:
 - Inheritance enables one class to inherit the characteristics of another.
 - Type casting enables you to check and interpret the type of a class instance at runtime.
 - Deinitializers enable an instance of a class to free up any resources it has assigned.
 - Reference counting allows more than one reference to a class instance.

 Unless you need to use a class for one of these reasons, use a struct.

 Structures are value types, while classes are reference types.
